# Decision Tree Regression ML Model for FIFA Audience Stats
A simple Decision Tree Regression machine learning model for country's share of global world cup TV Audience by percentage.

## Results
This decision tree regression model produces a mean absolute error (see parent diretory for definition) of about 0.3064619883040936%!

# Background and How It Works
## Decision Tree Regression (Simplified Explanation)
The decision tree regression model is a simple model where a tree-like structure is created to cateogrize data. At the top we have our first decision node whch splits into other nodes which split into other nodes. This splitting represents different decisions that help categorize the data  and only ends when a prediction can be made (these nodes where a decision has been made are called leaves).

## Mean Absolute Error
This model's MAE based on current settings is about 0.306%!
