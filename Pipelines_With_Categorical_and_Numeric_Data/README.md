# Pipelines With Categorical and Numeric Data
Pipelines! Pipelines make code easier to read and less prone to errors, while also providing benefits such as higher-level functions (so we don't have to get into every detail/step of the preprocessing, analyzing, and modeling process)!

Here, I again build an ML model for __FIFA World Cup Audience Stats__, the same dataset used in the [decision tree and random forest modeling directory](https://github.com/Kyle-Pu/Python-Projects/tree/master/Decision_Tree_and_Random_Forest_Models) of this repo.

More coming soon!
