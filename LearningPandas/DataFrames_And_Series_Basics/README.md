# Exploring Data Frames and Series
Wrote a program to see how data frames and series are structured within Pandas! I also learned how to export data into csv files, Excel spreadsheets, and SQL databases (not included here)!

### Setup
Make sure to run `pip3 install openpyxl` before attempting to run these programs (assuming you're running Python 3)! This will ensure that writing data to Excel spreadsheets functions properly.

### Other Notes
This program contains a lot of comments because I tried an implementation where the user would enter their own data to construct the series. However, I encountered issues with importing modList from lists.py since this function was built specifically for number lists. I can get around this by re-implementing modList to work with strings, but since there's not really a practical purpose for a user entering their own data into a Series, I decided to leave the code as is.
